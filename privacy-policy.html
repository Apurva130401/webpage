                    <h2>4. How We Share Your Information</h2>
                    <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share your information in the following limited circumstances:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>On Your Behalf:</strong> The core function of our service is to act on your behalf. We will share information through your connected third-party accounts as you direct us to (e.g., sending an automated message from your WhatsApp account).</li>
                        <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We may share information with third-party vendors and service providers who perform services for us, such as hosting, payment processing, and data analytics. These providers are contractually obligated to protect your data and are prohibited from using it for their own purposes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court or a government agency).</li>

                    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
                    <p>We use a combination of technical, administrative, and physical controls to maintain the security of your data. This includes using encryption (such as SSL/TLS) to protect data in transit and at rest, and implementing strict access controls within our organization. While we take significant measures to protect your data, no security system is impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information.</p>

                    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
                    <p>We retain your personal information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you with our Services. We may also retain your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>

                    <h2>7. Your Data Rights and Choices</h2>
                    <p>You have certain rights regarding your personal information. Depending on your location, these may include the right to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Access, update, or delete the information we have on you.</li>
